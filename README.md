# FEATURING: React, Ramda, Redux and Connected Router

This project is a prototype of an e-commerse site using these libraries. The aim of the application is to get me more comfortable with functional programming, keeping application logic and filters in redux actions rather than the components themselves, and moving nearly everything to a Redux store, rather than just a select few things. Ramda and using a Redux Connected Router were new concepts to me and I will definitely be utilizing them in the future.

## Hard-coded mock API

There's no backend for this app, just some dummy data that gets delivered to us via async functions to simulate data fetching.

## Styling with Bootstrap

All styling was provided with the boilerplate for this project, I didn't customize any css classes, nor did I feel the need to get rid of the native HTML tags that I personally would never use. It's not pretty.
